# Machine Learning (CS-433) Project 1

## MICVD Prediction

This project aims to use to data from US health surveys
to predict the risk of getting coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial
infarction (MI). We use data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS),
a system of health-related telephone surveys that collects state data about
U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health
conditions, and use of preventive services.

## How to use

You will need `numpy` and `jupyter` to run the file, and besides Python’s standard library, there should be nothing else required.

Run the `run.ipynb` file to reproduce our results. This includes data cleaning, feature transformation, feature selection, model training, hyperparameter selection, cross-validation, and generation of the predictions on the test set.
